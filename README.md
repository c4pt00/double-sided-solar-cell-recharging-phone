the manufacturer of this one Motorola could have a discrete solar cell "photovoltaic" back (with different colors for customers choice)
the front "digitizer" could also have a "transparent solar cell.."photovoltaic cell" if one could ever be fabricated
if the standard solar cell "photovoltaic cell" could be see-through "transparent"
then there could be advancements in cellular phone digitizers and even used outside of this written idea for home and business windows

obviously definitely thought of before why isn't capturing gradual energy from light? sunlight or otherwise
